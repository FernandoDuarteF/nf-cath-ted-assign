> [!WARNING]
> **In development: this is not yet a working release.**
> The pipeline is still being built. Several steps are missing, and parameters and outputs may change without notice.
> Do not use it for production analyses yet. Until a first release, the working pipeline is [UCLOrengoGroup/domain-annotation-pipeline](https://github.com/UCLOrengoGroup/domain-annotation-pipeline).

## Introduction

**nf-cath-ted-assign** annotates protein structures with consensus domain boundaries and CATH superfamilies, following the approach of TED (The Encyclopedia of Domains).

It is a port of [UCLOrengoGroup/domain-annotation-pipeline](https://github.com/UCLOrengoGroup/domain-annotation-pipeline), built from the [nf-core](https://nf-co.re) template and following nf-core guidelines for modules, testing and linting. It is not an nf-core pipeline.

## Pipeline steps and status

| Step                              | What it does                                                                                                                                                                | Status      |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Input preparation                 | List the structures in each ZIP archive, split them into chunks, renumber experimental structures, keep single-chain proteins within a length range, fetch UniProt taxonomy | Available   |
| Domain segmentation and consensus | Chainsaw, Merizo and UniDoc, then a consensus of their domain boundaries ([#3](https://github.com/UCLOrengoGroup/nf-cath-ted-assign/issues/3))                              | In progress |
| Domain quality checks             | STRIDE, globularity, domain quality, pLDDT ([#6](https://github.com/UCLOrengoGroup/nf-cath-ted-assign/issues/6))                                                            | Planned     |
| CATH homology assignment          | Foldseek search against CATH, then contrasTED and Foldclass ([#7](https://github.com/UCLOrengoGroup/nf-cath-ted-assign/issues/7))                                           | In progress |
| Final results                     | Combine domain boundaries, quality metrics, taxonomy and CATH assignments into one table                                                                                    | Planned     |

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow, see [the Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/install.html) for how to install it.

Prepare a samplesheet listing ZIP archives of PDB files, one archive per row:

```csv title="samplesheet.csv"
file_id,zip_file,structure_type
afdb_shard_1,/path/to/afdb_shard_1.zip,predicted
pdb_entries,/path/to/pdb_entries.zip,experimental
```

See the [usage documentation](docs/usage.md) for details of each column.

To try the parts that work so far on a small test dataset:

```bash
nextflow run UCLOrengoGroup/nf-cath-ted-assign \
   -r dev \
   -profile test,docker \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_.

## Pipeline output

See the [output documentation](docs/output.md) for the files the pipeline currently produces.

## Credits

nf-cath-ted-assign is being developed by Chris Wyatt, Fernando Duarte, Ian Sillitoe and Nick Edmunds, porting the domain-annotation-pipeline developed in the Orengo group at UCL.

This pipeline uses code and infrastructure developed and maintained by the [nf-core](https://nf-co.re) community, reused here under the [MIT license](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/blob/main/LICENSE).
